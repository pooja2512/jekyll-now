**Hello World!!.Welcome to my journey in the field of Data Analysis.**

**1. Now you might wonder why I decided to become Data Analyst.**

I have a bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering but after 1-2 Years of working I had lost interest and somehow one day I got introduce to "python" by my Brother.Untill then I never knew a whole world of data analysis even exists.Well I think that lot of people have this false belief that they are locked into whatever they decided to pursue in college or whatever the first job was.There is lot flexibility and I think if you find something you really like and you really want to pursue.There is probably a way to make it happen.I was lucky enough to find my way by joining Udacity's [Data Analyst Nanodegree Program](https://in.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002).

**2. How I took action.**

Majorly Data Analysis Involved Statistics and Programming

- **Statistics** - I did had statistics in school and even in the undergraduate program I was learning mathematics.So won't be problem need to brush up things and I am good to go .I took Udacity's [Descriptive Statistics Course](https://in.udacity.com/course/intro-to-descriptive-statistics--ud827-india) and [Inferential Statistics Course](https://in.udacity.com/course/intro-to-inferential-statistics--ud201). Statistics Check.

- **Programming** - I was introduced to programming in the first year.It was pretty fun but I was never knowing I would be interested in working in such fields in future though. Need to work a lot here.

**3.Journey of Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree till Now.**

I am currently in the term 2 of [Data Analyst Nanodegree Program](https://in.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) But the journey so far is amazing.I have got to work on different projects in python and R.

- I have learned data analysis tools like Pandas,Numpy,Matplotlib,Seaborn to explore and visulaize data.
 
- Data never comes clean and sometimes its not even avaliable easily I learned how to gather it by web scraping, get images using API The whole process of Data gathering, Data wrangling and Exploration is fun.

**4. Why I particularly loved data Analysis?**

- For me it allowed to be detective.For every new case you have to go into a  new field to try to understand how it works.
- It allows you make to make informed decisions.
- It can be applied to many different domains.

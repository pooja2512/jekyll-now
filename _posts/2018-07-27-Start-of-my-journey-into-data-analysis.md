I completed a bachelors in electrical engineering back in 2015. A graduate with no job offer from College, the reason behind no companies visited my college. I struggled enough to grab my first job as Management Trainee. But surprisingly I wasn’t happy with the work I was doing. Everything lasted for 2 years.

It was a time when I was working on AutoCAD and DIALux I heard about analytics. I discovered that there is lots of fascinating stuff that can be analyzed across a number of industry verticals, and developed a tremendous interest right then.

I think you probably need to pick something you find personally exciting because the road is long. If you hate the work the journey won’t seem like it’s worth taking.

While searching for the advantage of python I stumbled upon one of the examples below.

## Java
class Hello 
{
  
  public static void main( String args[] ) 
  
  {
     System.out.println(" Hello World ");
  
  }
  
 }


## Python
print("Hello World")

Well,you can do exactly what you need to do with python, print the text without any additional work. There is not that much syntax in this example, but you could already see that Python syntax is relatively simple, that does the right thing  for someone like me with no prior programming experience.”That’s a BIG Advantage”Though,I have learned in my undergrad basic C++,Java but I am not confident enough.

## Learn relentlessly and without excuses
I decided that every night, no matter what, I’d spend an hour with a programming. Not every night was wildly productive but I was able to  build up my new programming muscles.I moved slowly, but I never lost any ground.

By the time I decided I want to pursue Data Analysis.I think that lot of people have this false belief that they are locked into whatever they decided to pursue in college or whatever the first job was.There is lot flexibility and I think if you find something you really like and you really want to pursue.There is probably a way to make it happen.I was lucky enough to find my way by joining Udacity’s [Data Analyst Nanodegree Program](https://in.udacity.com/).Course Started on 14th of March,2018.

Next up Discover the world of Data analysis that I never knew existed.
